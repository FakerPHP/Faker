# Contributing

If you've written a new Formatter, added a new locale, or fixed a bug, your contribution is welcome!

Before proposing a pull request, check the following:

* Your code should follow the [PSR-12 coding style guide](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) will handle compliance automatically.
* Unit tests should pass after your patch. Run the tests in your local environment (with `make test`) or check the continuous integration status for your pull request.
* As much as possible, add unit tests for your code
* Never use `rand()` in your Provider. Faker uses the Mersenne Twister Randomizer, so use `mt_rand()` or any of the base generators (`randomNumber`, `randomElement`, etc.) instead.
* If you add a new Provider and it embeds a lot of data (e.g. first names in a new language), please add a `@see` PHPDoc to the reference you used for this list (example [in the `en_US` locale](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker/blob/main/src/Faker/Provider/en_US/Text.php#L35)). This will ease future updates of the list and debates about the most relevant data for this Provider.
* If you add long list of random data, please split the list into several lines. This makes diffs easier to read, and facilitates core review.
* If you add a new Formatter, please document it in [the documentation](https://github.com/FakerPHP/fakerphp.github.io). Please add a line about the new Formatter in the `@property` or `@method` PHPDoc entries in [Generator.php](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker/blob/main/src/Faker/Generator.php#L6-L118) to help IDEs with autocompletion.
* If your new Formatter is specific to a certain locale, document them in the respective [locale documentation](https://github.com/FakerPHP/fakerphp.github.io/tree/main/docs/locales).
* Avoid changing existing sets of data. Some developers use Faker for seeding unit tests, changing the data makes their tests fail.
* Speed is important to Faker. Make sure your code is optimized to generate thousands of fake items in no time, without consuming too much CPU or memory.
* If you commit a new feature, be prepared to help maintaining it. Watch the project on GitHub, and please comment on issues or pull requests regarding the feature you contributed.

Once your code is merged, it is available for free to everybody under the [MIT License](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker/blob/main/LICENSE). Publishing your pull request on the Faker GitHub repository means that you agree with this license for your contribution.

**Thank you for your contribution! Faker wouldn't be so great without you.**
